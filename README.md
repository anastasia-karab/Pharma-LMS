# Pharma-LMS
Learning Management Sytem for pharmaceutical company workers. <br>
<br>
The system consists of courses with presentations attached to them. After viewing each presentation a worker should complete a quiz. Each quiz can be done several times, but only the first result would be saved. If the first result is unsatisfactory, the admin can delete it and send a message to the worker asking him/her to take the test again. <br>
<br>
The worker sees the courses they should take depending on their department. <br>
<br>
Regarding quizzes, admin has two options: he can either upload a ready json file with quiz or add each question, answers and correct index manually. <br>
